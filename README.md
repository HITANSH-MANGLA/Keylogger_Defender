# üîê Keylogger Defender Tool

A full-stack cybersecurity project that simulates, detects, and defends against keylogger-based attacks. This project includes a custom keylogger developed in **C# (.NET Framework)**, a **Flask server** to receive keystroke logs, and a **Python-based GUI with a detection system** to monitor and alert users of potential keylogging activities.

## üìå Project Components

### 1. üéØ Keylogger Module (C# ‚Äì .NET Framework)
- Captures all keystrokes from the user's system.
- Stores them in a `.txt` log file.
- Sends logs every **30 seconds** to a remote Flask server using HTTP POST.
- Runs silently in the background.

### 2. üåê Remote Server (Flask ‚Äì Python)
- Receives incoming keystroke logs.
- Automatically organizes them into folders based on the device ID.
- Stores all data securely for analysis.

### 3. üñ•Ô∏è Defender GUI (Python)
- Visual interface to view received log files.
- Automatically lists devices and their respective log folders.
- Built using `Tkinter` / `PyQt`.

### 4. üõ°Ô∏è Detection System (Python)
- Monitors outgoing network activity for signs of keylogger infection.
- Identifies frequent unknown IP communications.
- Generates alerts if suspicious patterns are detected.
